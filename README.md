# GeoGenMX
Georeferencing published genetic data of Mexican biodiversity. This is based on [Miraldo et al (2017)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6307/1532.full) approach but adapted to a higher resolution for Mexico and including more taxonomic groups.

Functions in the order they should be run to retrieve data from BOLD and GENBANK are at each of their folders, you can see these R Markdowns on the following links:
